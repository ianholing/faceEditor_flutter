# Face Editor Flutter App

This is a real world Application which claims to be a good starting point for a Flutter applications that wants to use Machine Learning or Artificial Intelligence as a part of them.

This is a really simple proyect with almost no-structure focused on:

- Using a real custom tensorflow lite model loaded locally and used offline. A custom model made by myself, not the usual models preloaded from Tensorflow team and used in all tutorials. You can check out the model [here](https://github.com/ianholing/faceGAN_face_editor) 
- Consume an AI API also created by myself. A little one with not much complications and runnning on a Raspberry Pi 4 hardware at home. You can check out the server [here](https://github.com/ianholing/faceEditor_server/)
